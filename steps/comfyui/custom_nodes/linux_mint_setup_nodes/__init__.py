"""Small ComfyUI nodes that apps using this machine's ComfyUI through its
HTTP API need (linux-mint-setup's steps/comfyui installs this folder into
ComfyUI's custom_nodes/).

BBoxFromJSON: box prompts for SAM 2 (ComfyUI-segment-anything-2's
Sam2Segmentation, installed by the same step). Its `bboxes` input only
takes a link - in the API format a literal list is read as a [node, slot]
link - so a client sends its boxes as a JSON string through this node.
